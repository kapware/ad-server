# adserver

Simple ad matching engine.

## Building

Download and install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install), then build uberjar:

    $ lein uberjar

This will produce executable jarfile of the service.

## Usage
To run you need java installed. To run the service:

    $ java -jar adserver-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Limitations

The service was built with following limitations in mind (either deferred to a separate layer or a service, or just to draw boudaries):

* No authorization is explicitly provided (but can be opt in for as a ring layer)
* Deserialization and serialization is expected to be realized before calling the ad service. Specifically the service will merely return a pointer to the actual ad content and expects to have deserialized 
* No caching.
* The service is by design symmetric so that bastion wrapper (like graphql) can select relevant entity fields.
